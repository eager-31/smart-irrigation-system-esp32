## 📖 Overview

The Smart Irrigation and Environmental Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution developed using ESP32, DHT22, MQTT, and Blynk Cloud.

The system continuously monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. Based on predefined thresholds and hysteresis logic, it automatically controls irrigation while also publishing sensor data to the cloud through MQTT and displaying live information on a Blynk dashboard.

This project demonstrates embedded systems, IoT communication, cloud connectivity, and remote monitoring capabilities.

## ⚙️ System Workflow

```text
Start
  │
  ├── Read Soil Moisture
  ├── Read Temperature
  ├── Read Humidity
  │
  ├── Apply Hysteresis Logic
  │
  ├── Control Pump
  │
  ├── Publish Data to MQTT Broker
  │
  ├── Update Blynk Dashboard

## 🔧 Working

1. ESP32 reads soil moisture values through ADC.
2. DHT22 provides temperature and humidity readings.
3. Hysteresis logic determines whether irrigation should be enabled or disabled.
4. Pump status is indicated through an LED.
5. Sensor data is displayed on the Serial Monitor.
6. Sensor values are published to an MQTT broker (HiveMQ).
7. Real-time data is displayed on the Blynk mobile dashboard.
8. Users can remotely monitor and control the system through the Blynk app.
